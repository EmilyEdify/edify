    "Kristen has changed the way I think not only about employee onboarding, but about building a company. I'm more mindful about creating a healthy culture where everyone grows and thrives, and co-creating that plan with our team. Companies can't succeed without strong, capable, empowered, successful teams. And successful teams cannot be built without a champion there to create that path to success. Kristen is that champion."
