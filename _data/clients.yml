    "Kristen has changed the way I think not only about employee onboarding, but about building a company. I'm more mindful about creating a healthy culture where everyone grows and thrives, and co-creating that plan with our team. Companies can't succeed without strong, capable, empowered, successful teams. And successful teams cannot be built without a champion there to create that path to success. Kristen is that champion."

    "We were able to successfully outline an onboarding program for our tech team members in Portland that accelerated their time to proficiency and effectiveness. It can be challenging to work with a consultant on a project like this because they are not ingrained in the culture. Kristen however did a good job of listening to our feedback and incorporating it into the work she did."

    "You were extremely flexible and understanding during a difficult time in our company, you were approachable and down to earth (not preachy) with your knowledge. You were inclusive with all members of the session and made them feel a part of it. You representing me better than any other consultant/outside person has ever done! Managers and others are now actually talking about Performance Management in a way that is inspiring, realizing we need to do a better job at it and their openness and willingness to participate. People should know that you are excellent at what you do, extremely humble and so incredibly thorough."

    "When we started working with Edify, we definitely knew we needed to create a more streamlined structure for onboarding our technical team members. However, there were differences of opinion on how to do that - Kristen was able to hear our thoughts and concerns across the business and partner with HR and our technical teams to create a program that works for us. I have managers telling me how happy they are that there are templates and tools for them to use when they bring on a new hire, and one even said ‘I think we should have done this years ago - this is going to have value for us even if we never hire again!’ I can say confidently that we have a program that is helping us scale and acclimate new team members without taxing our managers and current teams. If you get the chance to work with Kristen, definitely take that opportunity! "
