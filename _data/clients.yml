    "Kristen has changed the way I think not only about employee onboarding, but about building a company. I'm more mindful about creating a healthy culture where everyone grows and thrives, and co-creating that plan with our team. Companies can't succeed without strong, capable, empowered, successful teams. And successful teams cannot be built without a champion there to create that path to success. Kristen is that champion."

    "We've been able to begin to add the meat to the structure that our meetings produced. We're implementing much needed workflows and policies that will help Retailmakr to hire well, perform well, and terminate well. Kristen is knowledgeable, respectable, and a very good listener. These things, coupled with being able to facilitate discussion and keep moving forward helped us stay on target to completing what we set out to do. At our first meeting, I was afraid of a cookie-cutter approach. It didn't take very long for me to realize that the fear was not founded."
