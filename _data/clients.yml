    "Kristen has changed the way I think not only about employee onboarding, but about building a company. I'm more mindful about creating a healthy culture where everyone grows and thrives, and co-creating that plan with our team. Companies can't succeed without strong, capable, empowered, successful teams. And successful teams cannot be built without a champion there to create that path to success. Kristen is that champion."

It can be challenging to work with a consultant on a project like this because they are not ingrained in the culture. Kristen however did a good job of listening to our feedback and incorporating it into the work she did."

    "You were extremely flexible and understanding during a difficult time in our company, you were approachable and down to earth (not preachy) with your knowledge. You were inclusive with all members of the session and made them feel a part of it. You representing me better than any other consultant/outside person has ever done! Managers and others are now actually talking about Performance Management in a way that is inspiring, realizing we need to do a better job at it and their openness and willingness to participate. People should know that you are excellent at what you do, extremely humble and so incredibly thorough."
