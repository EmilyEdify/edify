    "Kristen has changed the way I think not only about employee onboarding, but about building a company. I'm more mindful about creating a healthy culture where everyone grows and thrives, and co-creating that plan with our team. Companies can't succeed without strong, capable, empowered, successful teams. And successful teams cannot be built without a champion there to create that path to success. Kristen is that champion."

    "We were able to successfully outline an onboarding program for our tech team members in Portland that accelerated their time to proficiency and effectiveness. It can be challenging to work with a consultant on a project like this because they are not ingrained in the culture. Kristen however did a good job of listening to our feedback and incorporating it into the work she did."
