**Welcoming new employees doesn't have to hurt.**

The first day at a new job is always a time for excitement, perhaps a little anxiety, and a set of customs as familiar as the dishes served at Thanksgiving: meeting new coworkers, filling out HR  paperwork, settling into a workspace. But just as Thanksgiving dishes vary widely from table to table, each company's onboarding experience is unique. And all too frequently, it seems, onboarding is far from helpful or satisfying for new employees.

The cause of these less-than-ideal experiences isn't hard to fathom. Designing and implementing an effective onboarding program can be difficult, especially for HR professionals facing seemingly endless demands for their finite time and resources. Successful onboarding requires employees at multiple levels of the company to participate in formal and informal teaching and mentoring. It requires a deep understanding of the company's culture, and a plan for how to meaningfully impart those cultural priorities. And it requires the ability to carefully balance time spent on big-picture thinking with the natural desire to ramp up new employee time-to productivity as quickly as possible.
