 Note to myself:
 * remember to change the URL for the pinterest "share button" once the site goes live
 * change the prose links after I transfer ownership of the repo
 *change footer admin link

###Add to admin pg:

*how to force some styles:*
<div class="clearfix bottommargin"></div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<img style="width: 80%!important;" alt="upfront & indirect onboarding costs for mid-level engineer" src="/img/cost-of-not-onboarding4.png">

*explain that html won't render properly in prose - have to save and view on site
