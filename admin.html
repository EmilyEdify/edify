            <h4>Learn about the important elements that make up a Blog Post</h4>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              There are three parts to that make up a blog post and each is described below. <br>
              It's important to assemble these correctly as they will enable the code rendering the files to do so properly.
            </p>

            <div class="clearfix bottommargin-sm"></div>

            <h4>Part 1: The Content</h4>

            <h5>Files:</h5>
            <p>
              All blog post files live in the folder `_posts`.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a few key things to know about the blog post files:
            </p>
            <ul class="iconlist">
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                The <strong>file ending</strong> is `.md` (short for markdown); <br>
                this enables you to use a shorthand type of html that's faster and easier to type (more on this in a moment).
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                The <strong>file naming pattern</strong> is `YYYY-MM-DD-blog-post-name.md`; <br>
                this is important in Jekyll so it lists and renders post chronologically (newest on top).  <em>The url for each post will only show `blog/blog-post-name`.</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                An <strong>important thing about file naming</strong>: files names should have <strong>NO capital letters, NO spaces, and NO special characters</strong> <br>
                Characters like: <strong>?, /, &, $,</strong> will cause problems in any file name. However, dashes are encouraged. <em>for example: `2017-05-25-blog-post-name.md`</em>
              </li>
            </ul>


            <h5>Images:</h5>
            <p>
              Images are not necessary for a post to work, to make a post without an image, simply leave the image meta data blank.
            </p>
            <p>However, if you do have an image, follow these guidelines for best results:</p>
            <ul class="iconlist">
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Image file names</strong> should have <strong>NO capital letters, NO spaces, and NO special characters</strong> <br>
                Characters like: <strong>?, /, &, $,</strong> will cause problems in any file name. However, dashes are encouraged. <em>for example: `image-file-name.jpg`</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Image file formats</strong> try to stick with `.png` and `.jpg` file formats - some of the others can cause problems and these two are more than enough to get the job done!
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Image sizes:</strong>
                Images are rendered three different ways in the blog; on the post listing, in the sidebar, and in the body of the post itself. The image size defined here is intended to maximize load-time efficiency & accomodate layout proportions without compromising the image quality.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Image should be at least 4-5 inches tall in a landscape ratio (wider than tall) - css layout should adjust to accommodate some variation within these parameters.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Image size assumes the picture resolution is 72 (common web image resolution - as opposed to print resolution which is 300)
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Multiple images: </strong> currently, blog post pages are not optimized for more than one image per post. While it is totally possible to add multiple images, they may not align perfectly.  <em>(Though they may align just fine - it depends on the rest of the content.) <strong>*This is current as of 6/9/2017</strong> </em>

              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Image file location: </strong> all blog and client images are saved in the folder named "img". This is set to default in Prose.io so you shouldn't need to do anything with this.
              </li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Part 2: The Meta Data</h4>
            <img style="float: right; height: 300px; margin-right: 2em;" src="/img/site-images/meta-data-icon.png">
            <p>
              Meta data (aka "FrontMatter" in Jekyll) is the list of variables that allow you to enter the information once and it can be duplicated all over the site - saving you a lot of time and effort.
            </p>

            <p>
              Prose has some very handy config options that make editing this super easy (watch the video to see the workflow) but here's a breakdown and description of each part of the meta data you will find in prose.
            </p>

            <p>
              You open the metadata panel by clicking the metadata icon in the upper right corner <i class="icon-arrow-right"></i>
            </p>
            <div class="clearfix bottommargin"></div>
            <div class="col-md-7">
              <ol class="metadata-description">
                <li>
                  <strong>Publish Date:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is here so you can update a post (like the services post that the process cards link to) so the date will look current without having to rename a file.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Add Category:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is set up using the tag feature in order to let you add your own categories by typing the name into the text field OR you can select an existing category from the dropdown menu. HOWEVER, the blog isn't set up to accept more than one category per post (we can create tags to do this if you want) so if you do accidentally add more than one category, the site will ignore all but the first category listed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One other cool thing - you can just type the format you want to be displayed - no need to mess around with "alternative_learning", you can now use "Alternative Learning". Or whatever you want.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Feature Post:</strong>
                  <p>
                    Check this option to have a post be automatically included on the home page. It is designed to accommodate three posts. Fewer posts may look unbalanced but you may be able to set six to show up there if you wish.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Post Width:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This will determine the size of the image in the main post body - the default is "half-width". If you have a post where you want a full width image, I recommend making sure the image is on the larger size of the image size guidelines (above) and that the image quality is reasonably high.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image File Name:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is where you type the file name of the image you will download using the prose.io download feature. This allows the image to appear in all the other locations blog images appear that are not the body of the post itself.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Image Alt Text:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is for Universal Design purposes - write a brief but descriptive bit about the image here.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Short Description:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is the text that will appear on the blog page and on the category list pages.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Raw Metadata:</strong>
                  <p>
                    This is just a default of prose.io - you can just ignore it.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-5">

            <h4>Part 3: The Body</h4>

            <p>
              The body of the text is done in "markdown" - which is a much more simple way of recording and formating content than HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can find some basic prompts and guidelines in the prose.io editing panel here:

          <div class="tab-content clearfix" id="clients">

            <h4>Watch the tutorial on adding new clients</h4>
            <p>
              This tutorial goes through the workflow for adding a new client or editing content for an existing client.
            </p>
            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PeRbonMg3rA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <div class="clearfix bottommargin"></div>

            <h4>There are 4 steps to adding a new Client:</h4>

            <p>
              All client text content goes into the file 'clients.yml' file and client logos get uploaded in the same way as blog posts. <br>
              It's important to assemble these correctly as they will enable the code rendering the files to do so properly.
            </p>
            <img src="/img/site-images/clients.png" style="margin-bottom: 1em;">
            <div class="clearfix bottommargin-sm"></div>


            <h4>Step 1: Assemble your Content</h4>
            <p>
              Below are the data items you can include in a new client listing. Don't worry if you don't have all these pieces! You can leave a section blank by simply leaving empty quotes, like this => "".
            </p>
            <ol class="iconlist">
              <li>1. Client Company Name</li>
              <li>2. Project End Date</li>
              <li>3. Client Website URL</li>
              <li>4. Client Logo Image File</li>
              <li>5. Client Name (The person who gives the testimonial)</li>
              <li>6. Client Job Title</li>
              <li>7. Testimonial Text</li>
            </ol>


            <h5>Guidelines for Client Logo Image Files:</h5>
            <ul class="iconlist">
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Image file names</strong> should have <strong>NO capital letters, NO spaces, and NO special characters</strong> <br>
                Characters like: <strong>?, /, &, $,</strong> will cause problems in any file name. However, dashes are encouraged. <em>for example: `image-file-name.jpg`</em>
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>Image file formats</strong> should be `.jpg` or `.png` only
              </li>
              <li>
                <i class="icon-wrench"></i>
                <strong>The ideal image size = 3 inches wide x 1 inch tall</strong> (set largest dimension to the limit and then enlarge the canvas size to meet size requirements)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="clearfix bottommargin-sm"></div>

            <h4>Step 2: Copy the Template</h4>
            <p>
              Click the button below to copy the "New Client" template
            </p>
            <button id="copyButton" class="btn">Copy the Template</button>
            <pre id="copyTarget">
- company_name: "Insert client name here"
  project_end_date: "Insert project end date here"
  website: "Insert client website here"

  logo: "insert client logo file name here"

  client_testimonial_name: "Insert client name here"
  client_testimonial_job_title: "Insert client job title here"

  testimonial: |
    "Insert testimonial text here"
            </pre>
            <div class="clearfix bottommargin-sm"></div>

            <h4>Step 3: Paste & Edit the Template</h4>
            <p>
              Click the <a href="http://prose.io/#elauervose/edify/edit/master/_data/clients.yml" target="_blank">link to open the "New Client" page</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then paste the template at the bottom of the file and edit all the text fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Leave the fields you don't have content for empty like this -> ""</strong>
            </p>
            <div class="clearfix bottommargin-sm"></div>

            <h4>Step 4: Upload the Client Logo file</h4>
            <p>
              This part is a bit unusual - Prose.io has a great interface for uploading images but it is only accessible through the blog posts section. Fortunately for us, we can upload a file without needing to publish a post!
            </p>
            <p>
              The method for uploading a client logo is identical to uploading an image for a blog post - just be sure to put client logos in this unpublished draft post, then save the file with the new image but don't publish it!
            </p>
