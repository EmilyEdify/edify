I'm so thrilled to be sharing this with you right now. This post marks the beginning of a journey I've wanted to start for years, and to start it with you is absolutely humbling.

Edify Education Design represents my way of supporting a changing world, and "being the change I wish to see" too. First things first: want to lay out a couple of things about Edify and about this blog (managing expectations is always key...!)

You can expect a blog post about once a week, usually containing my thoughts on educational philosophy, great techniques, cool opportunities; that kind of stuff. This blog has closed comments, but if you'd like to share your thoughts with me, I'd love it! Send them to me at kristen@edifyedu.com. If you are looking for more regular interaction, check Edify out on these platforms:

You can always check out the Resources section to download helpful tools

If you'd like to meet up, I love tea! If it's about business, the first hour is complimentary.  Well, I'm excited to get started, and I hope you are too. Look for our next blog post in a few days!
