_Let’s not get carried away with customer growth. You wouldn’t have those customers if not for your employees._  

Brian Balfour recently wrote about [seeking authentic growth](http://www.coelevate.com/growth-machine/authentic-growth/), and something that struck me was how absolutely similar (wait… no, the same) his framework is to the framework for a successful employee lifecycle (shorthand for all the stuff that happens to and for an employee between the signed offer letter and the last day). The funny thing is, we don’t really measure it that well. You probably take great pains to measure customer growth, but what about employee growth?  

Balfour posits that authentic growth is trifold: **meaningful, sustainable, and repeatable.** For him, to be meaningful, growth must be useful for the customer and the company. Likewise, sustainable refers to your ability to keep and nurture customers. Finally, repeatable means focusing your energy on initiatives that will consistently deliver value, rather than one-off hits that take an insane amount of energy to execute on.  

##### Meaningful Growth for Employees  

If having an company that’s growing authentically means you’re seeking meaningful, sustainable, and repeatable initiatives for growing your customer base, then it also means you’re seeking the exact same thing for your employees.  

In startup land, where everything needed to happen yesterday and there is never enough time, employees sometimes get left out of the equation. We start to see them as fungible resources instead of human beings who can add immeasurable value to our businesses. So, what happens is we grow and suddenly find ourselves with 20, 50, 100, employees. And then, when there is a moment to breathe, we step back and realize there might have been a bit of carnage. But how? Customers are happy. Revenue is up. Why are there such bad reviews on Glassdoor? When we want to understand something, the first impulse for many of us is to try and measure it. It’s common to measure things like:
Number of applicants (overall, but also from various groups)
Number of interviews and screens
Number of internal promotions
Functional (meaning you’re glad the employee left) and nonfunctional (the opposite) turnover rates
Number of employee referrals for open roles
I’m not saying these aren’t valid and valuable; they are. Instead of starting with the metric, start with experience. See if your growth is as meaningful for your employees as it is for your customers:
Have we — and how have we — shared our mission with our team?
How invested are our employees in our mission?
Is the work our employees are doing meaningful?
How do we know it’s meaningful?
