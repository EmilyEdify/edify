It's time to get to work.

Welcome to 2017! It feels like Edify is waking up from a big sleep - maybe you feel that way too?

As you might know, Edify was on hiatus in 2016 to work with a client full time. I (Kristen, Edify's fearless leader) had a blast at AWS Elemental! I had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build learning & development programs that supported the growth of 400+ employees (the onboarding program alone brought on 180 team members in 9 months!)

But now it's time to get to work. I mean - really get to work. This year, Edify has launched an entirely new way to develop learning programs! We've figured out what growing tech companies really need and how to give that support to them. We've drastically simplified the process of building onboarding programs, manager learning & development, and technical training. We have applied our proprietary Learning Culture Framework to this work to help growth-stage companies get more by working simultaneously on learning and their knowledge management. This is the where the rubber meets the road in learning and development - it's where the real work happens.
